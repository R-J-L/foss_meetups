# Tallahassee FOSS Meetups

Tallahassee's homegrown FOSS meetup group. Something between a mutual support and therapy group and a GIS lab.  
  
# Guidelines for presenters and audience  
  
The first half of each meeting is volunteer-led instruction. The second half is a freeform experimentation/mutual assistance/bullshitting session.  

**Presenters:**
  + Target is 45-60 minute length.  
  + Focus is 'how to do X using FOSS'  
  + Have any prerequisites - software and data - to Seth at least 7 days prior to your scheduled presentation.  
  + Do your best to keep any example data relatively small in size.  
  + **Do NOT** use proprietary or private data in your presentation!  
  + Slides and handouts should be platform agnostic and exported to HTML or PDF. HTML is strongly preferred.  
  + Bring digital copies of your materials with you so Seth can post to github.  
  + Don't stop your presentation to troubleshoot a single person's technical issue - take care of it in the second hour.  
  + Failure is OK!  
  
**Audience:**  
  + Bring your laptop  
  + Have any prerequisites downloaded and installed when you arrive  
  + If you hit a technical snag and can't resolve it youself, wait until the second half to ask for assistance
