# Virtual Machines & Linux Basics  
  
## Virtual Machines  
  
  + Simulates hardware  
    + Host = 'bare metal OS'  
    + Guest = the VM
  + "A computer within a computer"  
  + Several available options: VirtualBox, Hyper-V  
  + Allows one physical server to act as many smaller servers  
  + Virtualization translates diretly to cloud services  
  + Compromized guest OS is 'sandboxed' and attacker cannot escalate to the host  
  
## Ubuntu  
  
  + Most popular linux distro  
  + Easy to trouble shoot with google
